# Music Player Frontend

React UI for browsing and streaming the local music library served by the backend. The app handles authentication, triggers library imports, lists tracks, and provides a simple audio player for the selected song.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if present) or create a `.env` file and set `VITE_API_URL` when the backend is not running on `http://localhost:4000`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Build production assets with `npm run build`.

Use `npm run preview` to serve the production build locally.

## Linting

Run `npm run lint` to execute ESLint with the provided configuration.
